                    <h4>Environmental Assessment Act</h4>
                    <p>The Environmental Assessment Act provides a mechanism for reviewing proposed major projects in British Columbia, including major mining projects, to assess their potential impacts. The Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) manages the assessment of proposed major projects as required by the Environmental Assessment Act.</p>

                        <h5>Reviewable Projects Regulation (Environmental Assessment Office)</h4>
                        <p>The Reviewable Projects Regulation of the Environmental Assessment Act provides for a broad range of major projects to be automatically reviewable if they meet certain thresholds, such as area or production volume.</p>

                    <h4>Mines Act (Ministry of Energy and Mines)</h4>
                    <p>The Mines Act and the accompanying Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia (the Code) protect workers, the public and the environment through provisions for minimizing the health, safety and environmental risks related to mining activities. Proposed major mines (e.g., metal and coal), major expansions/upgrades to existing mines, and some large-scale exploration/development projects require approval under the Mines Act as per part 10 of the Code.</p>

                    <h4>Environmental Management Act (Ministry of Environment)</h4>
                    <p>The Environmental Management Act (EMA) regulates industrial and municipal waste discharge, pollution, hazardous waste and contaminated site remediation. EMA provides the authority for introducing wastes into the environment, while protecting public health and the environment. The Act enables the use of permits, regulations and codes of practice to authorize discharges to the environment and enforcement options, such as administrative penalties, orders and fines to encourage compliance. Guidelines and objectives for water quality are developed under EMA.</p>
